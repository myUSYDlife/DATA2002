Both model remove **variables INDUS and AGE**

## Hypothesis testing 

### Dropping out the AGE

> $log(MEDV) = O + \beta_1 CRIM + \beta_2 ZN + \beta_3 CHAS + \beta_4 NOX + \beta_5 RM + \beta_6 DIS + \beta_7 RAD \\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ + \beta_8 TAX + \beta_9 PTRATIO + \beta_{10} B + \beta_{11} LSTAT + \beta_{12} INDUS + \beta_{13} AGE+ ε$

- **Hypothesis**: $H_0: β_{13}=0$ vs $H_1: β_{13}≠0$

- **Assumptions**: The residuals $ε_i$ are iid $N(0,σ^2)$ and there is a linear relationship between y and x..white[sds] .green[ (All of the assumptions are met. ✅)]

- **Test Statistic**: $T=\hat{β_{13}}/SE(\hat{β_{13}})∼t_{n−p}$ under $H_0$ where p is the number of estimated coefficients (including the intercept) and n is the sample size.

- **Observed test statistic**: $t_0 = 0.0002106/ 0.0005287 = 0.398$

- **P-value**: $2P(t_{492}>= |0.398|) = 0.691$

- **Conclusion**: Do not reject $H_0$ at the 5% level of significance as the p-value is greater than 0.05. Hence, there is no evidence to suggest that there is a significant linear relationship between MEDV and AGE and it can be dropped from the model.

**Log-linear model** $$log(Y) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x$$ On average, a one unit increase in $x$ will result in a $\beta_1$ * 100% change in $Y$. 


.scroll-box-8[

- A one degree parts per million(ppm) increase in NOX results in 72.17% decrease in MEDV on average, holding other variables are constant. 
- A 1 CHAS (if tract bounds Charles River) results in 10.51% increase in MEDV on average, holding other variables are constant.
- A one number of room increase in RM results in 9.07% increase in MEDV on average, holding other variables are constant.
- A one unit weighted distances to five Boston employment centres increase in DIS results in 5.17% decrease in MEDV on average, holding other variables are constant.

# Key Conclusions

.blockquote[- House price down ⬇️: CRIM, NOX, DIS, TAX, PTRATIO, LSTAT
- House price up ⬆️: ZN, CHAS, RM, RAD, B]

As NOX and CHAS is a variable that effects the house price the most, we can infer that the demand for the clean air and nature view was high at that moment, which also aligns with the fact that the data was originally published in "Hedonic prices and the demand for clean air".

The increase in room number (represented by RM), decrease to five Boston employment centres(represented by DIS), decrease pupil-teacher ratio by town (represented by PTRATIO) is also factor that increases the boston price.  

The bigger the ratio of lower status of the population, it  decreased the Boston house price and better accessibility to radial highways increased the Boston house price while increase in crime rate decreased the Boston house price.

# Limitations

- Assumption for Homoskedascity : Even though the residuals vs fitted plot showed fairly random plot, since it had some part mildly fanning out, further test is needed for Homoskedascity. 

- Bounded MEDV : The house price (MEDV) was censored at 50.00 (50,000 dollar). That is, 16 cases that has 50.00 at their MEDV might have higher price than $50,000. Therefore, further research with precise house price is needed to get the model that is better representing the Boston house price. 

- Small sized data set : The data set has 506 cases, which is large enough to make the model statistically reliable and representative. However, as the dataset sheet argued, it is not enough number to represetn the whole Boston house price. Increased number of data with better representation on overall Boston house price is needed to make the model more representative.
